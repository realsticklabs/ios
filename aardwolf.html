<h1>Aardwolves</h1>
<p>The aardwolf, meaning "earth wolf" in Afrikaans, is a unique and specialized mammal native to the African savannas, known primarily for its unusual diet consisting almost entirely of termites, setting it apart from its hyena relatives who are typically carnivorous predators; its solitary nature, and its adaptation to feeding on insects through a long, sticky tongue, making it a fascinating creature within the African ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>While resembling a smaller, less robust hyena in appearance, the aardwolf has a distinctive slender body with a striped coat, a bushy mane along its back, and relatively large ears which aid in detecting termite activity.</p>
